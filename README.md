# Angular Application:

  The angular application is in the folder angular-app.\
  Run the following commands:\
  1. `npm install`
  2. `ng serve` (on the understanding you have angular && angular cli installed).
  3. URL : `http://localhost:4200`

# Node Application 
  The Node application is in the folder transactions-api-test\
  Run the following commands in the transactions-api-test folder :
  1. `npm install`
  2. `npm run start`
  3.  URL : `http://localhost:3000`
     
  # Note
  I have not used mongoDB, because i would be using only one query using mongoose as my ORM

  ``` await model.find({}); ```

  where the model object is the used by mongoose to interact with the mongo db database.

  also the query in MongoDB without mongoose would be 

  ``` db.collection.find({}) ```

  Also I havent used Sass in my application because i have written extremely less css but if i had to use sass , i would only be using variables for this problem which i can reuse in the future and font details.
